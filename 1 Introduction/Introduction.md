# Module 1: Introduction to Frontend Development

Welcome to Module 1 of the **Complete Frontend Development Course**. In this module, we will explore the fundamentals of frontend development, understand the tools and technologies involved, and set up your development environment.

## 1.1 Overview of Frontend Development

Frontend development involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It focuses on everything that users interact with directly in their web browsers.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Designing and implementing visual elements
- Ensuring responsiveness across devices
- Optimizing performance
- Enhancing user interaction

## 1.2 Frontend vs. Backend Development

### Frontend Development:
Refers to the client-side part of the application. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and style the visible part of the application.

### Backend Development:
Refers to the server-side of the application. It involves server, database, and application logic which users don't see directly. Technologies include server-side languages (Node.js, Python, Java) and databases (MySQL, MongoDB).

## 1.3 Tools and Technologies

### Text Editors:
- VS Code
- Sublime Text
- Atom

### Browsers:

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the role and responsibilities of a frontend developer.
- Differentiate between frontend and backend development.
- Familiarize yourself with essential tools and technologies.
- Set up a basic development environment and start your first project.
